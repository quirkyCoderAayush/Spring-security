# Spring-security
This is my spring security with JWT implementation repository.

This repository demonstrates a robust implementation of Spring Security integrated with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application.

Features
1- JWT Authentication: Secure API endpoints with token-based authentication.
2- User Role Management: Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
3- Secure Endpoints: Protect resources using Spring Security filters.
4- Custom Authentication Filter: Handle JWT validation and user context setup.
5- Token Refresh Mechanism: Ensure seamless user experience with token refresh capabilities.
6- Spring Boot Integration: Clean, modular structure using Spring Boot best practices.

Technologies Used:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- MySQL Database
- Maven

Getting Started:

1- Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

2- Configure the database and JWT secret in application.properties.
3- Build and run the application:
   mvn spring-boot:run
4- Use tools like Postman to test API endpoints.
